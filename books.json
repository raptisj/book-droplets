The aura of confusion and even acrimony that surrounds public debate about the condition discourages a reasoned discussion of how environment and heredity might mutually affect the neurophysiology of children growing up in stressed families, in a fragmented and highly pressured society and in a culture that seems more and more frenzied.","goodreads_link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2390505.Scattered_Minds"},{"FALSE":"FALSE","created_at":"19/05/2021 9:39:20 μ.μ.","title":"Skin in the Game","subtitle":"Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life","author":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","publication_date":"19/01/2018","genre":"non-fiction","complementary_genre":"philosophy","genre_recommendation":"","excerpt":"Skin in the Game is about four topics in one: a) uncertainty and the reliability of knowledge (both practical and scientific, assuming there is a difference), or in less polite words bull***t detection, b) symmetry in human affairs, that is, fairness, justice, responsibility, and reciprocity, c) information sharing in transactions, and d) rationality in complex systems and in the real world.

By the side of the path, amid the sea-campion flowers, sits a female eider duck, dark brown and broody, silently incubating her clutch of eggs. I stoop to take a picture of her with my iPhone from a few feet away. She is used to this: hundreds of visitors come here every day in summer and many will take her picture. for some reason, an idea pops into my head as I click: a riff on the second law of thermodynamics based on a remark by my friend John Constable. The idea is this: the electricity in the iPhone's battery and the warmth in the eider duck's body are doing roughly the same thing: making improbable order (photographs, ducklings) by expending or converting energy. And then I think that the idea I've just had itself, like the eider duck and the iPhone, is also an improbable arrangement of synaptic activity in my brain, also fuelled by energy from the food I have recently eaten, of course , but made possible by the underlying order of the brain, itself the evolved product of millennia of natural selection acting on individuals, each of whose own improbabilities were sustained by energy conversion. Improbable arrangements of the world, crystallized consequences of energy generation, are what both life and technology are all about.","goodreads_link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52219273-how-innovation-works"},{"FALSE":"FALSE","created_at":"19/05/2021 9:41:51 μ.μ.","title":"How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big","subtitle":"Kind of the Story of my Life","author":"Scott Adams","publication_date":"19/01/2013","genre":"biography","complementary_genre":"humor","genre_recommendation":"","excerpt":"If you're already as successful as you want to be, both personally and professionally, all you are likely to get from this book is a semi-entertaining tale about a guy who failed his way to success.
