Attention deficit disorder is usually explained as the result of bad genes by those who "believe" in it, and as the product of bad parenting by those who don't. The aura of confusion and even acrimony that surrounds public debate about the condition discourages a reasoned discussion of how environment and heredity might mutually affect the neurophysiology of children growing up in stressed families, in a fragmented and highly pressured society and in a culture that seems more and more frenzied.
