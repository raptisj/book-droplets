If you're already as successful as you want to be, both personally and professionally, all you are likely to get from this book is a semi-entertaining tale about a guy who failed his way to success. But you might also notice some familiar patterns in my story that will give you confirmation (of confirmation bias) that your own success wasn't entirely luck. That's the sort of validation you can't get from your family and friends who see you as a hot mess.
